# Comic-Con-Management-System-Database-Design
Database design using ERD, SQL Server, and normalization techniques

A large crowd of people assemble at Comic-Con to honor various comic book and anime characters. Fans, exhibitors, artists, and businesspeople from the industry make up the audience for this event. A lot of data is generated at Comic-Cons, including attendee registration data, agreements with exhibitors, panel programs, artist biographies, merchandise sales, and details on the event's logistics. There must be an efficient system to manage and streamline event operations, enhance attendee experiences, and facilitate stakeholder communication. So, to manage these things we can build a comprehensive and centralized database that can efficiently store, retrieve, and manage diverse types of data related to the event.
